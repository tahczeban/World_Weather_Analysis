# World_Weather_Analysis

***RESOURCES***

Jupyter notebook, Numpy, Pandas Library, CitiPy, matplotlib library, Python requests, Google maps API's, SciPy and JSON Traversals

***OVERVIEW***

The purpose of this assignment was to perform API retreival of metadata, analyze and present visualizations for Jack's PlanMyTrip app and some Beta testers. The first part was the retreival of weather data. The second entailed the implementation of input statements to filter the weather data for four selected, preferred cities. In order to complete the travel itinerary, a travel route was created, as well as a marker layer map for additional information.

***RESULTS***

In part one, the weathr database was created considering the following data:
- latitude and longitude
- max temperature
- percent humidity
- percent cloudiness
- wind speed
- current weather description
